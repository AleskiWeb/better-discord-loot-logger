# Better Discord Loot Logger
This plugin will take a screenshot (optionally) and sent that along with a message via a discord webhook anytime you get a pet, valuable drop or collection log slot.

Main reason for making this over using any other one out there is none seemed to have support for collection log items.

# Setup
To set this up find the discord channel you want the notifications to go to and click the settings icon -> integrations -> webhooks -> New Webhook
Then copy and paste this webhook into the input field in the plugin and thats it!
